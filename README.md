# field-kit

Over our years of work within the internet freedom sphere, Okthanks has observed a communication gap between tool development teams and the activists, journalists, and human rights defenders they seek to serve. What is needed is a secure, efficient, and accurate method for collecting feedback from high-risk communities. In an effort to efficiently and accurately collect important data for developers while protecting the anonymity of users, Okthanks has developed the Field Kit.

The Field Kit offers an easy way to deploy effective and secure research methods. It is designed specifically for high-risk users, and takes into consideration that, in many cases, a field partner (third party interviewer) will be facilitating the conversation. Composed of frameworks, or activities, the Field Kit  creates a safe space for users to give honest feedback, while not compromising their personal privacy. 

The kit contains research methods and activities that, when combined effectively and deployed within target communities, will help teams answer the following questions:

* Are people interested in doing this kind of thing?

* Why aren’t people adopting it?

* Where are the usability pain points?

* We have a lot of user feedback on usability issues, but want more input to know which are most common and important to solve first. What are they?

* Which features are people most interested in using?

* Who is my end user?

* We just released a new feature and want to know how people like it and how well it will work for them. How well does this feature actually work for people?

* We just had a spike in users in ‘x’ country. Why?

* Are users able to get started?

* What perceptions do people have about popular streamline apps that offer similar capabilities?

**Why It’s Important**

We have a responsibility to the people using our tools—those who put their trust in us and the products we create. Further, we have an accountability to the Internet Freedom community to be actively working to establish trust, listening to one another and producing reliable tools. 

Currently, we lack clear measures of accountability within the field, because gaps still exist in our process. We lack easy, engaging and safe methods to facilitate useful, impactful end-user feedback into the design and development process. We must close these gaps as a commitment to our users. By establishing common ways to gather and report useful feedback, we can build trust in the process, trust in the tools, trust in the community, trust in adoption. Our hope is that by creating frameworks for feedback along with a sustainable submission process we can add to the narrative of transparency within the field and the voice of <a href="https://morethancode.cc/T4SJ_fullreport_082018_AY_web.pdf">“Nothing about us, without us.”</a>
